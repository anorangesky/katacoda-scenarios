# Before we start...

## Do I have to have some basic understanding of JavaScript to follow this tutorial?
Yes. We expect you to also know hor the React and Redux framework works, but the tutorial is possible to follow even if you don't. 
But you would get more out of it if you do ofc. 

## What is "Jest"?
- “Jest is a  testing library for JavaScript code. With it, you can create, run, and structure tests.”
- “Aims to be zero config”, “snapshots”, “isolation of tests to maximize performance”, “entire toolkit in one place”, etc. 

## How do you know what to test?
- UI, all pages of the app, functions, modules 
- “Whenever you write new functions - test it”

 ## What is a typical test-flow?
1. Choose a function to test (test as small pieces of code as possible in one go)
2. Give it an input
3. Define what to expect as the output
4. Evaluate the results
