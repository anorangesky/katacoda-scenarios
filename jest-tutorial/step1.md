# Short on testing
Before we start with the real deal it is important to have some fundamental understanding of tests in general. To be able to open up this Jest-crash course you must pass the quiz at the end of this slide. Good luck, and happy learning! 

## What is a meaningful test?

## What are some test strategies?
There are different types of test and the three most common way of talking about them is through the testing pyramid (seen to the right). A Test Strategy is a plan for defining an approach to how, when and by whom, these different tests should be implemented. There are multiple test strategies available that fit differently well to different projects. Like TDD, STEP, and CTP. What is typical for the majority of strategies is that the automated tests follow a structure of:
1. Setup initial state
2. Dispatch an action
3. Expect data to change
