Well done - Let's get started!
# Setup

We have created a dummy project that you will use throughout this tutorial. It is covering a basic log-in flow, and you will be responsible for writing tests for it. The first thing we need to do is install the necessary packages needed.

1. By default you are in the 'root' directory. We have created a dummy project for you to work on within this tutorial. It is a react project describing a login flow. To redirect to the dummy project, type:
 - `cd ~/kataUser/dummy-react-app/src/`{{execute}}
 - `ls`{{execute}}
2. To be able to run the react project we need to install npm and its necessary packages.
 - `npm install`{{execute}}
3. This may take a while... in the meantime, take a look at this easter egg: ![easteregg](./assets/easterEgg.png) And when you have looked at it check out the file structure of the react project we have created for you. 
4. When the npm installation is done, let's see how it looks like in production! To see it on your localhost type `npm start`{{execute}} and the website will be hosted on port 3000.

Let's continue to dive deeper into the Jest testing framework in the next step!
