# You are done!

In summary, you have hopefully learned:

* How to write your first test in jest. 
* How snapshot tests for web components work and when to use them. 
* How to read dom elements, trigger events and test reactive web components. 
* How to mock functions, spy on them and validating calls to the mocked function.
* How to mock any npm package by using the `__mocks__/` folder.

Things that we do not go into in this guide that are worth reading into:

* Testing routing with **React Router**. Most front-end apps use routing in some form. 
* Testing sessions & JWT (Json Web Tokens). Authentication and sessions are important both for user experience and security. 
* When to e2e test, and use an Selenium based testing framework or Cypress as a complement to jest. 
* You can always learn more about mocks. Inline component mocks for example are great to learn.
* https://reactjs.org/docs/testing-recipes is a great source of knowledge when looking for solutions to simple problems and style recommendations. Sites like this are a great asset that should be referenced by beginners and professionals alike. 

We hope you enjoyed our guide, and that you are now are more comfortable reading tests, writing good tests and working with TDD when developing React applications.
