Learn how to set up a test-environment for React-Redux projects using Jest. Jest is a testing library for JavaScript code. With it, you can create, run, and structure tests. It can be installed using npm (which we will do). Following this tutorial you will learn how to write unit and integration tests, integrate them with a GitHub repository and get a better understanding of why it is important and relevant to have good test coverage.

## Do I have to have some basic understanding of JavaScript to follow this tutorial?
Yes. We expect you to also know hor the React and Redux framework works, but the tutorial is possible to follow even if you don't. 
But you would get more out of it if you do ofc. 

## What is "Jest"?
- “Jest is a  testing library for JavaScript code. With it, you can create, run, and structure tests.”
- “Aims to be zero config”, “snapshots”, “isolation of tests to maximize performance”, “entire toolkit in one place”, etc. 

## How do I know what to test?
- UI, all pages of the app, functions, modules 
- “Whenever you write new functions - test it”

## What is a typical test-flow?
1. Choose a function to test (test as small pieces of code as possible in one go)
2. Give it an input
3. Define what to expect as the output
4. Evaluate the results
