This is a crash course in Jest testing on React projects.
 
## What will I learn after finishing this tutorial?
In this tutorial, you will learn how to set up a test environment for React projects using the JavaScript testing framework “Jest”. With Jest, you will be able to create, run, and structure tests.
You will be focusing on the Log-in flow of a react project where you will learn:
   - What makes a test meaningful
   - How to get up to speed with Jest
   - What Snapshot tests are and how to write them
   - How to write Unit test in Jest and when they should be implemented
   - What Spies are (Mock functions), how to write them and when they should be implemented
   - More about code coverage in Jest
 
## Do I have to have some basic understanding of JavaScript to follow this tutorial?
- Yes.
- We also expect you to know how the React framework works, but the tutorial is possible to follow even if you don't.
