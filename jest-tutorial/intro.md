## What will I learn after finishing this tutorial?
-  You will learn how to set up a test environment for React projects using the JavaScript testing framework “Jest”. With Jest, you will be able to create, run, and structure tests. 
-  In this tutorial, you will be focusing on the Log-in flow of a react project. As a bonus, you will get a better understanding of why it is important and relevant to have good test coverage.

## Do I have to have some basic understanding of JavaScript to follow this tutorial?
- Yes. 
- We expect you to also know how the React framework work, but the tutorial is possible to follow even if you don't. 

## How do I know what to test?
- “Whenever you write new functions - test it”
- The most fundamental parts to cover in your code are:
  - UI elements
  - The loading of all pages of the app
  - The different functions and modules(small as big) 

## What is a typical test-flow?
1. Choose a function to test (test as small pieces of code as possible in one go)
2. Give it an input
3. Define what to expect as the output
4. Evaluate the results
